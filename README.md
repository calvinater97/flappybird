# Overview

This software was my attempt at creating the flappy bird game.  It allows you to jump as the bird while having pipes that come towards you.  This was a good project to work on because it allowed me to try using the pygame library for the first time and problem solve when I ran into issues.

# Development Environment

To develop my software I used Visual Studio Code using the python language.  This was all done with the pygame library.

# Future Work

* Need to make the code loop through the pipe images to have them continue being created until player hits one.
* Need to create a collision function to check for when the bird hits the pipes.
* Update the way the pipes look to make them more visually appealing.
